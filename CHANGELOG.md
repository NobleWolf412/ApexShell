# Apex Shell Changelog

## Unreleased

- **STUDIO shell** (`extensions/studio/`): a new dock pane (order 20 — the slot
  PERSONAS held) that hosts the builders as sub-views behind PERSONAS|PROJECTS
  sub-tabs. Exposes the `ApexStudio.registerBuilder({id, label, mount, order})`
  seam. The Persona Builder is re-homed into it unchanged (same DOM, styles, and
  bus traffic — only its registration seam moved from `ApexShell.registerDockPane`
  to `ApexStudio.registerBuilder`). PROJECTS ships as an empty placeholder for the
  App Builder (slice 2+). Extension load order gained an optional manifest
  `priority` so the studio host initializes before its dependents (renderer
  scripts now inject `async=false` to honor it). New `test:studio` drill, chained
  into `npm test`. (App Builder v1, slice 1 of 9.)

## 0.2.0 — 2026-07-17

Personas returned as a first-class, tool-driven system, plus a wave of
workflow, tracker, and UX work.

- **Persona Builder + cast**: a create/edit/archive persona system
  (`extensions/personas/`) with a workspace at `apex/personas`. Shipped the
  Architect (read-only planner), Auditor (read-only review + UX/UI lens), and
  Coder (implementation + debugging) cast. Read-only is enforced technically
  via a per-persona toolset wall (`tools`/`disallowedTools` in seatconfig).
- **TODO board** (renamed from TASKS): persona-route chains, the Delegate-from-
  chat path, a seat-first packet-ask ladder before any hand-typed summary, and
  the **apex-todo** block — any chat can post/refresh a checklist on the board.
- **MCP tracker**: a CONTROL CENTER pane showing active-in-project vs available
  MCP servers with live health via `claude mcp list`; graphify + serena made
  global (cwd-resolved).
- **Live auditor**: opt-in per-seat shadow review (haiku), with an auto-stop
  ceiling and a hung-pass backstop.
- **Local lane**: switched Ollama default from Qwen to gpt-oss:20b (+ llama3.1
  fallback); UI relabelled "Local (Ollama)".
- **Viewer**: pin-to-hold + a history strip of recent artifacts; readable text.
- **UX pass**: clickable tracker chips, keyboard shortcuts + a `?` cheat-sheet,
  named workspaces (with a scratch default) + rail-menu manage controls,
  ApexPrompt (the missing `window.prompt`), and a batch of correctness fixes
  from a full audit sweep (timer leaks, propagation bugs, stale-state races).
- **Model dial**: `fable` alias sent to the wire as its full model id on both
  launch and live-switch paths (CLI alias regression workaround).

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-15

- Created the independent Apex Shell repository from the proven standalone app.
- Shipped built-in Viewer and Terminal dock tabs.
- Kept AI seats, PTY terminals, trackers, themes, backgrounds, and drop-in extensions.
- Removed all persona, pipeline-worker, lab-specific, credential, transcript, and operator-state coupling.
- Added the agent-led install contract and Windows launcher.
- Published the public GitHub repository at `Ir8code/ApexShell` while retaining
  the private Vault remote as the build machine's canonical upstream.
- Fixed web links being misread as Windows paths at the `s:/` inside `https://`;
  HTTP(S) targets are now fully visible, clickable, keyboard-accessible, and
  opened externally only after explicit user activation.
