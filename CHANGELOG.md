# Apex Shell Changelog

## Unreleased

- **STUDIO shell** (`extensions/studio/`): a new dock pane (order 20 — the slot
  PERSONAS held) that hosts the builders as sub-views behind PERSONAS|PROJECTS
  sub-tabs. Exposes the `ApexStudio.registerBuilder({id, label, mount, order})`
  seam. The Persona Builder is re-homed into it unchanged (same DOM, styles, and
  bus traffic — only its registration seam moved from `ApexShell.registerDockPane`
  to `ApexStudio.registerBuilder`). PROJECTS ships as an empty placeholder for the
  App Builder (slice 2+). Extension load order gained an optional manifest
  `priority` so the studio host initializes before its dependents (renderer
  scripts now inject `async=false` to honor it). New `test:studio` drill, chained
  into `npm test`. (App Builder v1, slice 1 of 9.)
- **App Builder contract library** (`extensions/studio/lib/`): the pure,
  Electron-free contract for portable project packages. `contract.js` carries the
  blueprint schema constants (schema v1, the six areas `idea`/`users`/`scope`/
  `platform`/`architecture`/`delivery`), safe project IDs, workspace-containment
  path handling, PROJECT.md frontmatter parsing, sha256 canonical hashing, and the
  deterministic `validateProjectPackage` rules — errors block (unsafe/mismatched
  id, malformed frontmatter/JSON, unsupported schema, workspace escape,
  would-overwrite, runtime-field leak), warnings review (incomplete area, hash
  drift, no non-goals, no verification), suggestions advise (thin vision/MVP,
  project overlap, orphan component). Validation never throws — it returns a
  structured `{ valid, errors, warnings, suggestions }`. `render.js` renders the
  canonical PROJECT.md from an approved shape with renameable headings behind
  stable `app-builder:<section>` markers. No provider, model, credential, or
  machine path may enter the package. New `test/studio-lib-drill.js` (with static
  fixtures under `test/studio-fixtures/`) chained into `test:studio`; zero LLM
  spend. No UI, no bus verbs. (App Builder v1, slice 2 of 9.)
- **App Builder workspace + drafts + interview** (`extensions/studio/`): the
  PROJECTS sub-tab is now a working guided interview. A projects-workspace picker
  (`ctx.pickDirectory`) persists the choice to `state/extensions/studio/workspace.json`
  with the persona discipline — schema-versioned, absolute path, atomic
  temp-file-plus-rename write. A crash-safe draft store (`lib/drafts.js`, sibling of
  the persona store: atomic `wx`+rename so an interrupted write only ever orphans a
  `.tmp`, symlink-refusing, revision-gated, workspace-isolated) keeps the in-progress
  interview — working name, one-sentence pitch, and the six card answers — under
  `ctx.stateDir`, never in the portable package; draft deletion is its own explicit
  action. The six interview cards (`lib/interview.js`, keyed to the blueprint areas)
  carry a plain question, expected-depth note, a complete example, suggested choices,
  and a **Help-me-decide** that is a pure client-side heuristic — card thought-starters
  plus live nudges (thin answer, scope with no non-goal, delivery with no verification);
  no AI or disposable call anywhere in this slice. The renderer mounts through the same
  `ApexStudio.registerBuilder({ id: 'projects' })` seam with a stepper + card flow, Back /
  Save draft / Skip, and a resume-or-delete draft list; all bus wiring is gated so the
  headless studio-drill still exercises the shell seam untouched. New
  `test/studio-drafts-drill.js` (create / save / reopen / crash-recover / delete, the
  workspace picker, the interview bus verbs, and the heuristic) chained into
  `test:studio`; zero LLM spend. (App Builder v1, slice 3 of 9.)
- **App Builder Blueprint Review + Canonical Draft** (`extensions/studio/`): the
  PROJECTS builder now carries the interview through to a delegable canonical.
  A new **Review** step shows the six structured answers with gaps highlighted; a
  new **Canonical** step generates PROJECT.md from **approved answers only** and
  never invents content — a missing area renders as an explicit, visible
  "incomplete" placeholder in its section (`lib/blueprint.js`, pattern-matched
  from the persona render bundle: `buildBundle` / `withCanonicalEdit` /
  `regenerateSection` / `acceptCanonical`, all using the slice-2 `renderCanonical`
  / `hashCanonical` primitives rather than duplicating them). Card→section
  partition: `idea`+`users` collapse into "Vision and Users", each other card owns
  one section, and "Risks and Open Questions" (no dedicated card in v1) is authored
  by hand — a visible gap until then, never a split-and-invent of the delivery
  answer. **Hash-drift** is detected against the approved blueprint snapshot
  (persisted on the draft, `lib/drafts.js` gaining a validated `preview` field so
  drift survives reload/crash): a manual edit surfaces a **review prompt** —
  re-approve (adopt + rehash) or regenerate from answers (discard the edit) — and
  is **never** a silent regeneration. **Targeted per-section regeneration**
  re-renders one section from its approved answer, leaving the others and any manual
  edits elsewhere intact. The **validation report** projects the slice-2
  `validateProjectPackage` rules (errors block, warnings review, suggestions advise)
  by staging the preview into an ephemeral temp package and running the same
  contract — no validation logic is re-implemented, and no package is written to the
  projects workspace (that is slice 8). No AI or disposable call in this slice. New
  `test/studio-review-drill.js` (drift detection + review arms, section regen,
  gap rendering, the validation projection, draft-store snapshot persistence, and
  the preview bus verbs) chained into `test:studio`; zero LLM spend. (App Builder
  v1, slice 4 of 9.)
- **Disposable launch override — the engine slice** (`main/engine/seatHost.js`,
  `main/seats.js`): `createDisposable` and the `ctx.seats.startDisposable`
  extension seam accept an optional `launch: { model, effort }`. `model`
  validates against the Claude-lane tiers ONLY (`fable | opus | sonnet |
  haiku`) — a disposable always spawns via `claudeSeat`, so codex/qwen/agy are
  rejected with a clean thrown `Error` before any scratch dir or child process
  exists (no crash, no fallback spawn). The pre-existing flat `model`/`effort`
  params (`main/audit.js`'s haiku pass) still work unchanged — `launch`, when
  given, simply wins over them — and omitting `launch` entirely (the shape
  `personaTestPrepare`/`personaRelSuggestLlm` already use) is byte-identical to
  before this slice; `main/seats.js`'s `startDisposable` stays a pure
  passthrough, so the engine is the single validation gate. The engine stays
  Electron-free (zero new imports in `seatHost.js`). Added the **STUDIO header
  model picker** (`extensions/studio/lib/modelPicker.js`): one choice,
  persisted atomically in `state/extensions/studio/model.json`, shared across
  builders — nothing calls a disposable with it yet (slices 6/7 will). New
  `test/engine-harness.js` cases (valid tier honored — a real spawn; non-Claude
  lane rejected — pure, no live spend; omitted launch = legacy — a real spawn
  matching today's exact call shape) plus `test/studio-model-picker-drill.js`
  (hermetic, zero LLM spend) chained into `test:studio`. `npm run test:live`
  gates the engine cases. Update & restart applies. (App Builder v1, slice 5
  of 9 — the engine touch.)
- **App Builder per-card AI suggest pass** (`extensions/studio/`): each
  interview card now offers an opt-in AI pass alongside its free heuristic
  chips — one disposable turn, never run without explicit approval. Mirrors
  `extensions/personas/main.js`'s `personaTestPrepare`/`personaRelSuggestLlm`
  pattern exactly: `projectsCardSuggestPrepare` reports a usage snapshot
  (`ctx.usage.claudeSnapshot()`) and stamps a 5-minute TTL (same order as
  personas' `TEST_PREPARE_TTL_MS`) on the prepared-but-unapproved state;
  `projectsCardSuggestRun` refuses to fire without `approved: true`, re-checks
  the TTL and the draft's revision, and allows only one pass at a time. The
  disposable call (`ctx.seats.startDisposable`) carries `launch: { model,
  effort }` sourced from the STUDIO header picker
  (`modelPicker.readModelPick`) — omitted entirely when no pick is saved yet,
  byte-identical to the legacy path per slice 5's contract. A 120-second
  backstop timer (matching `personaRelSuggestLlm`'s) force-finishes the pass
  with an error if the seat never answers, and `done()` always posts a result.
  New `lib/suggest.js`: the prompt builder (the card's question + the current
  answer + every existing project's `project-context.md` digest, read via
  `contract.readSiblingContexts` — reused, not reinvented, for overlap
  detection) and the untrusted-reply parser, which allows only a bounded,
  capped list of suggestion strings (`MAX_SUGGESTIONS`/`TEXT_CAP` matching
  `relationships.js`'s own caps) — oversize is trimmed rather than rejected,
  unknown fields and wrong-typed entries are dropped silently, and a missing
  JSON block, non-JSON payload, or empty reply fails closed to an empty list
  plus a clear error, never a thrown exception. Parsed suggestions render as
  chips on the card; clicking one proposes text into the free-text answer —
  the AI never writes the draft directly, the user still saves/next for it to
  count. New `test/studio-suggest-drill.js` (parser: valid / oversized /
  hostile / non-JSON-empty-missing-block; prompt builder as a pure function;
  and the full prepare→approve→run bus wiring driven through a stubbed
  `ctx.seats.startDisposable`, covering the approval gate, TTL expiry,
  revision staleness, single-flight, a dead seat, the backstop, and the launch
  passthrough) chained into `test:studio`; zero LLM spend. Renderer edits
  apply on Reload; the `main.js`/`contract.js` changes need Update & restart.
  (App Builder v1, slice 6 of 9.)

## 0.2.0 — 2026-07-17

Personas returned as a first-class, tool-driven system, plus a wave of
workflow, tracker, and UX work.

- **Persona Builder + cast**: a create/edit/archive persona system
  (`extensions/personas/`) with a workspace at `apex/personas`. Shipped the
  Architect (read-only planner), Auditor (read-only review + UX/UI lens), and
  Coder (implementation + debugging) cast. Read-only is enforced technically
  via a per-persona toolset wall (`tools`/`disallowedTools` in seatconfig).
- **TODO board** (renamed from TASKS): persona-route chains, the Delegate-from-
  chat path, a seat-first packet-ask ladder before any hand-typed summary, and
  the **apex-todo** block — any chat can post/refresh a checklist on the board.
- **MCP tracker**: a CONTROL CENTER pane showing active-in-project vs available
  MCP servers with live health via `claude mcp list`; graphify + serena made
  global (cwd-resolved).
- **Live auditor**: opt-in per-seat shadow review (haiku), with an auto-stop
  ceiling and a hung-pass backstop.
- **Local lane**: switched Ollama default from Qwen to gpt-oss:20b (+ llama3.1
  fallback); UI relabelled "Local (Ollama)".
- **Viewer**: pin-to-hold + a history strip of recent artifacts; readable text.
- **UX pass**: clickable tracker chips, keyboard shortcuts + a `?` cheat-sheet,
  named workspaces (with a scratch default) + rail-menu manage controls,
  ApexPrompt (the missing `window.prompt`), and a batch of correctness fixes
  from a full audit sweep (timer leaks, propagation bugs, stale-state races).
- **Model dial**: `fable` alias sent to the wire as its full model id on both
  launch and live-switch paths (CLI alias regression workaround).

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-15

- Created the independent Apex Shell repository from the proven standalone app.
- Shipped built-in Viewer and Terminal dock tabs.
- Kept AI seats, PTY terminals, trackers, themes, backgrounds, and drop-in extensions.
- Removed all persona, pipeline-worker, lab-specific, credential, transcript, and operator-state coupling.
- Added the agent-led install contract and Windows launcher.
- Published the public GitHub repository at `Ir8code/ApexShell` while retaining
  the private Vault remote as the build machine's canonical upstream.
- Fixed web links being misread as Windows paths at the `s:/` inside `https://`;
  HTTP(S) targets are now fully visible, clickable, keyboard-accessible, and
  opened externally only after explicit user activation.
